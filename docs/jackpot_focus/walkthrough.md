# Jackpot Focus Development Walkthrough

A standalone ADHD-focused ToDo application created in the `lab` directory.

## Changes

### New Files

#### [jackpot_focus.html](file:///d:/github/kageticasite/lab/jackpot_focus.html)
- Created a single HTML file integrating React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide icons via CDN.
- Implemented the full "Jackpot Focus" application logic including:
    - Task management with urgency/importance/quick-win attributes.
    - Priority sorting algorithm.
    - 30-minute timer and focus mode.
    - Gamification elements (rewards, confetti, roulette).
    - LocalStorage persistence.
    - Lucide icon integration using a custom wrapper component.

## Verification Results
